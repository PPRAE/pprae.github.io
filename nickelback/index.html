I feel like anyone who dislikes Nickelback doesn't do it for the actual quality of their music. There is nothing objectively wrong with their music; nothing is out of tune, off beat, or painful. They rose to fame and popularity because they appealed to some people. Comments regarding the idea that their music all sounds the same is an argument that could be made about most bands in existence. The Story So Far is the good example - most of their songs and every one of their singles are heavy hitting pop punk bangers with the same vibe and lyrical content - Parker's failed relationship(s). No one complains about it because they like it. A Nickelback fan doesn't complain that their songs sound the same for that exact reason. I would go as far as to say Nickelback has greater dynamics and variety as a band than arguably the greatest modern pop punk band. So, if you don't like Nickelback, you're probably hopping on the bandwagon of hatred started as a meme. and that makes me sad that you can't enjoy music for yourself. They are generic rock just like AC/DC. When told that a critic had accused the band of recording 10 albums that all sound the same, guitarist Angus Young quipped, “He’s a liar. We’ve made 11 albums that all sound the same.”
It’s the best comeback Young could’ve made, because no one listens to AC/DC for variety. They listen to AC/DC to get some all-out, balls-to-the-walls rock and roll, and boy do they deliver. Give Nickelback an honest try and you'll likely be surprised.
