					<h2 class="center-text" >DON’T BE A DICK</h2>
						<p>This one is simple. “Be excellent to each other.” Don’t shit talk other people’s plays.
							If someone finds your language offensive, be considerate, do the adult thing, and save it for your buddies.</p>

					<h2 class="center-text" >PLAY WHAT YOU LOVE</h2>
						<p>Yeah, We’re called Pop Punk/Rock/Alternative/Emo, but we’re still a <i>“play anything”</i> room.
							We just happen to love those genres the most. Queue up what you love most and share it with us. We’re always looking for something new and great.</p>

					<h2 class="center-text" >EASE UP ON THE DOWNVOTE</h2>
						<p>No "nope'ing". Since we allow pretty much everything, we want people to feel confident in trying something new.
							Downvoting can shy people away from sharing something new, something amazing.</p>
						<p>Save it for <s>one of the indie rooms</s> Indie While You Murder, they love that shit.</p>

					<h2 class="center-text" >AFK DJS</h2>
						<p>Our room bot is configured to automatically remove any DJs who haven't voted or sent a chat message for 30 minutes. Please say something or vote within that timeframe while DJing, or you will automatically be removed. This feature is sometimes disabled by the night crew.</p>

					<h2 class="center-text" >LONG SONGS</h2>
						<p>As a rule of thumb, keep your plays to 10 minutes or below. If you want to play something longer, just ask the room. When there's 10 or more DJs, try to keep your play to 6 minutes or less. You can still ask the room if it's cool to play something longer. Some of the best tracks are pretty long.</p>

					<h2 class="center-text" >
						BONUS ROUND!<br>
						YO CAPT, CAN I SPIN MY OWN STUFF?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sure, but follow the room rules first. Talk to the mods, maybe we could even have a listening party in your honor.
						Just don’t come in acting like you rule the place demanding your music be played.
						It’s just not going to be a good time for anyone, even if your music is cool. If you have any questions, read rule 1 again.
